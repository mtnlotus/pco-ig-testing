# Test Data for PCO FHIR Implementation Guide

This FHIR IG is derived from the [Person-Centered Outcomes (PCO) IG](https://mtnlotus.github.io/pco-ig/index.html) and uses FHIR Short Hand (FSH) to define and generate FHIR resources based on the PCO profiles to test interoperability and quality measures.
