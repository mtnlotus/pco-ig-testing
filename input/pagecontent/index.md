### Introduction

Person-Centered Outcomes (PCO) focus on setting and achieving specific, personalized goals that prioritize an individual's well-being and "What Matters Most" to each person. Rather than just treating symptoms, this approach involves close collaboration between patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers to identify individual goals related to health outcomes, functional improvement, or symptom management. After goals are established, tailored care plans are developed, incorporating various treatments, therapies, and lifestyle adjustments to meet the individual's needs and preferences. Continual monitoring and adjustment ensure alignment with evolving priorities, fostering patient engagement and satisfaction while enhancing overall healthcare effectiveness. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are two approaches used to establish goal targets and track achievement progress.

This FHIR IG is derived from the [Person-Centered Outcomes (PCO) IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/mtnlotus/pco-ig/index.html) and uses FHIR Short Hand (FSH) to define and generate FHIR resources based on the PCO profiles to test interoperability and quality measures.
